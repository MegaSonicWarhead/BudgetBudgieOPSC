New Features

We’ve introduced several major updates to enhance the player experience, including Ivan the Mascot, the In-Game Shop, and expanded account and category functionality.

Ivan the Mascot

Ivan is an animated mascot whose behavior dynamically changes based on the player’s daily spending habits. If the player exceeds their daily budget, Ivan will show his disappointment. Staying within budget rewards the player with points, making good financial habits more engaging and fun.

In-Game Shop

Points earned from maintaining a positive budgeting streak can be spent in the in-game shop to purchase cosmetic items for Ivan.

Expanded Account and Category Functionality

Users can now create and manage multiple accounts with ease. Additionally, we’ve introduced an envelope-style system for budget categories, allowing for clearer organization and better control over spending. This system helps users allocate funds more effectively and visualize how their budget is distributed.
